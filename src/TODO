Possible improvements
---------------------

* Get rid of pos fields from expressions, they only seem to be needed during
  type checking (which we don't do anyway).

* Tidy up the layout submodule. Make it more useful and generic.

* Rework the maketest submodule in light of the technical report
  (simplify, more reuse from generic routines in nta/parsednta).
  Possibly separate out the bits for creating and manipulating clock
  expressions (could be useful for other types of Uppaal manipulations.)
