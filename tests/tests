Test format
-----------
Each test file is an Uppaal model containing a single template named
`Template' (the default for a new model). The global declarations should
begin with a comment of the form:
/*
    description: <free form description, may cover multiple lines.>

    error:       <a non-zero error code if the test is expected to fail>
    stderr:      <expected messages on stderr>

    system:	 <an optional replacement system declaration>

    layout:      <a value for the graphviz/engine setting>
    scale:       <a floating point scaling factor>
    tabulate:    <yes|no>

    author:      <author name>
    created:     <creation date: yyyymmdd>
 */

All fields are optional. Blank lines are ignored.
Fields may cover multiple lines but should not contain any of the field
tags, i.e. the names above including colons.
The closing comment brace `*/` must appear on a line by itself.

Testing Procedure
-----------------
1. The test file is processed by urpal to create a new template: `Test'.
   The layout fields are respected.
2. The return code and stderr text are compared with the values given.
3. The system string is set to: system Template, Test;
4. Uppaal attempts to verify the model against: A[] (not Test.Err)
